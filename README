libnexstar
==========

This library implements the serial commands supported by the Celestron
NexStar hand control. This applies to the NexStar GPS, NexStar GPS-SA,
NexStar iSeries, NexStar SE Series, NexStar GT, CPC, SLT, Advanced-VX,
Advanced-GT, and CGE mounts.

Communication to the hand control is 9600 bits/sec, no parity and one
stop bit via the RS-232 port on the base of the hand control.

Communication can be established over TCP/IP if nexbridge is running
on the computer connected to the telescope.
